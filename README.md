# GoPomodoro
GoPomodoro is a small app used to improve time management with the technique called [pomodoro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique).
The application is written in Go with use of [Fyne v2](https://github.com/fyne-io/fyne) gui library.

# Goal
The aim was to create a small-windowed app which does not bother you while working but subtly prompts you to keep your eyes on the goal.

## Download & usage
As for dev build, app is available to download directly from /build directory in a .exe format.
It does not require any prerequisites such as images or sound files.
